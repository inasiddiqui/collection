                                    My first reading was ”The Web’s Grain” by Frank Chimero. One can explain the essay on the context of responsiveness but Chimero touched upon various outlooks in web design combined with philosophy and future approaches. He talks about how we must acknowledge and understand that The web is forcing our hands. And this is fine! Many sites will share design solutions, because we’re using the same materials. The consistencies establish best practices; they are proof of design patterns that play off of the needs of a common medium, and not evidence of a visual monoculture.
For the next two readings I went ahead with “ Writing Interface” by Nicole Fenton. 
This visual narration immediately got me interested because it paid so much attention to language and response. She says that writing for Humans is an iterative process and with time needs to adapt to language, but should never lack clarity of action and thoughts. The third topic I went ahead with was “ The Programmed Designer” by   John Patrick Hartnett. He talks about the impacts of standardisations of tools - Apple computers, Adobe software – have created astonishing new possibilities for graphic designers. But is this liberation, or a new kind of imprisonment? 
Relating it to an open source web project where the user/programmer is also innovating the platform they work on. All these essays touch upon various nodal points of the web and interactions with it. While Chimero starts with the framework study and how to be compliant with the structural grain of the web, we can find utmost clarity and solutions.

    Nicole Fenton says something similar but in the context of language, instructions and communication. She describes how she is overwhelmed with commands and instructional language around her. </div>
    <div class="preface" >
    Both these writers begin from a sense of overwhelming emotions. They intend to reach for clarity in a simplified way. Something which is coherent with its context. The programmed designer is set a little ahead in time and rightly so points out the 

It talks about mega organizations and web players like Adobe andApple who are industry standards when it comes to Digital or print design. Stallman has written that ‘[Society] needs information that is truly available to its citizens – for example, programs that people can read, fix, adapt and improve, not just operate. But what software owners typically deliver is a black box that we can’t study or change. When a program has an owner, the users lose freedom to control part of their own lives.’ This reading blends with the rest in a way that it also questions the tools of the trade.  This resonates with the views of David Reinfurt, who has noted how ‘technically sophisticated users want to modify, fix, or add to […] software. They want access to the technology, because that is where the power resides. It takes what we learn in the first two readings and provides a new perspective on standardization and templatizing culture. 
<br>
The three readings clubbed together touch upon how to design and write for the web. But goes on to further explain how we can be even more cognisant to the tools at the same time.  It questions the layout, the content and even the tool.  The first two readings were based around the same time but with the third closing monologue it gives us insights into the power of the web and where it actually resides. Something that Chimero touches upon in their own ways.
Also the three readings inform us about trends and practices in the times of their conception. Cumulatively giving the reader an insight into the past and provoking them to reflect in the present.
