                <div class="info"> The web and the world are full of instructions. Everywhere you go, signs and people are telling you what to do.

                        Walk. Don’t walk. <br>
                        Follow me please. Stop. Hang on. Please stand clear.<br>
                        Fasten your seatbelt. Read this.<br>
                        Take this. Buy this. Find us on Facebook. Please enter your name.<br>
                        You get the idea. So bossy.

                        Think about the app you’re building right now.

                        What actions can people take? What are you asking them to do? What are you allowing them to do? What are the rules and dead-ends? What sort of language do you use to guide people?
                        <br>
                        Whatever you’re building, you need to think about the content in the database and the instructions around it. I call those things interface writing. Some people call them microcopy since they’re usually short.

                        <br>

                                From navigation links and buttons to product tours, forms, and error messages—every string in your database is an instruction. These are your signposts, and they grab your reader’s attention.

                        As developers and writers, you have a lot of power. The user wants something. Maybe it’s information, an easier way of doing things, chocolate chip cookies, or hilarious cat videos.
                        With clear instructions and a warm tone, you can help them find what they need quickly without having to ask anyone for help.

                        Let me tell you a story. This is my dad. He’s a test engineer. He works on semiconductors and develops tests for parts and batteries. So growing up, we always had computers around the house and the latest in PC technology.

                        We used to have this program called Dr. Sbaitso, which you may have heard of. It was a computerized psychologist slash artificial intelligence program designed to show off sound cards, but I thought it was a game and used to play with it for hours.

                        This is what it looked like. A typical, boring DOS interface.
